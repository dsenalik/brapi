.. note::

  Please note that this module supports a limited number of fields that are part of the Breeding API specifications.

If the Breeding API does not display all the data you expect for a given entry, make sure you associated the appropriate Chado Controlled Vocabulary term with the fields managed by this module. Your data should also be stored in Chado the way the Breeding API Drupal module expects it to be. If you store things differently, consider also storing them the way this module expects them to be stored.
